Weâ€™re delighted to announce the launch of Flutter 3 as part of the Google I/O keynote. Flutter 3 completes our roadmap from a mobile-centric to a multiplatform framework, with the availability of macOS and Linux desktop app support, along with improvements to Firebase integration, new productivity and performance features, and support for Apple Silicon.
