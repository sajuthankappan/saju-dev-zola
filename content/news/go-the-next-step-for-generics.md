It\u2019s been almost a year since we last wrote about the possibility of adding generics to Go. It\u2019s time for an update.

We\u2019ve been continuing to refine the generics design draft. We\u2019ve written a type checker for it: a program that can parse Go code that uses generics as described in the design draft and report any type errors. We\u2019ve written example code. And we\u2019ve collected feedback from many, many people\u2014thanks for providing it!
